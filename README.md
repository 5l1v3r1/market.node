Market.Boost
============

An open source financial exchange toolkit from [Furosys Solutions](http://www.furosys.com/).

## Goals
* Facilitate rapid development of high-performance, scalable exchanges.
* Provide FAST 1.2, FIX 5.0, and JSON-over-HTTP reference gateways.

## Build Dependencies
* Clang 3.2+ and a recent build of libc++
* [CMake](http://www.cmake.org) 2.8.x for easy cross-platform compilation.
* [Boost](http://www.boost.org) 1.53 for asynchronous I/O, among other things.
* [MySQL Connector/C++](http://dev.mysql.com/downloads/connector/cpp/) for database connectivity.

## Supported Platforms
Development is done on MacOS X Mountain Lion with FreeBSD 10 as the primary deployment target.

Modern Linux distributions should also work, but are relatively untested. 

Windows is unsupported. 

## Build instructions
Coming soon!

## Credits
Enormous thanks to [Object Computing, Inc.](http://www.ociweb.com/) for their excellent, liberally licensed libraries:

* [Liquibook](https://github.com/objectcomputing/liquibook): an incredibly fast order matching engine.
* [QuickFIX](http://www.quickfixengine.org/): a FIX message parser. 
* [QuickFAST](https://code.google.com/p/quickfast/): a FAST message parser.

Without their hard work, this project would not be possible.
